# Mando Front-end Technical Assessment Solution

This repository contains the completed solution for the Mando Front-end Technical Assessment. This project showcases a web application that dynamically displays cards representing online courses for students, incorporating responsive design, interactivity, and accessibility features.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5** - For structuring the content.
- **CSS3** - For styling. We use CSS Grid and Flexbox to achieve responsive layouts across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** - For dynamic client-side scripting.
- **React** - Used as the front-end library for building the user interface (assumed based on the common use in such projects; replace with actual technology used if different).
- **SVG Icons** - To represent the course categories visually.
- **Yarn & NPM** - For managing project dependencies.
