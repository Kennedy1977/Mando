# Mando Front-end Technical Assessment Solution

This repository contains the completed solution for the Mando Front-end Technical Assessment. This project showcases a web application that dynamically displays cards representing online courses for students, incorporating responsive design, interactivity, and accessibility features.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5** - For structuring the content.
- **CSS3** - For styling. We use CSS Grid and Flexbox to achieve responsive layouts across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** - For dynamic client-side scripting.
- **React** - Used as the front-end library for building the user interface (assumed based on the common use in such projects; replace with actual technology used if different).
- **SVG Icons** - To represent the course categories visually.
- **Yarn & NPM** - For managing project dependencies.

## Running the Project

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:
- Node.js
- npm (Node Package Manager)
- Yarn (Optional, as an alternative to npm)

### Clone the Repository

Start by cloning the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Kennedy1977/Mando.git
cd Mando
```

### Install Dependencies

You can use either npm or Yarn to install the dependencies. Choose one of the following methods:

#### Using npm:

```bash
npm install
```

#### Using Yarn:

```bash
yarn install
```

### Run the Application

To start the application on your local development server:

#### Using npm:

```bash
npm start
```

#### Using Yarn:

```bash
yarn start
```

The application should now be running and accessible via `http://localhost:3000` (adjust the port accordingly based on your project's configuration).

### Build the Project

To build the project for production:

#### Using npm:

```bash
npm run build
```

#### Using Yarn:

```bash
yarn build
```

This will generate a `build` directory with your compiled files, ready for deployment.

## Additional Information

This project demonstrates a high level of front-end proficiency by incorporating responsive design, accessibility considerations, and modern JavaScript practices. The layout adjusts from a four-column format on desktops to a single-column layout on mobile devices. The cards are interactive, with clickable elements that do not refresh the page, demonstrating SPA (Single Page Application) principles.
